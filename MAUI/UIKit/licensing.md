# Licensing in .NET MAUI Essential® UI Kit

.NET MAUI Essential® UI Kit source code published in GitHub with an MIT license. You can use this UI Kit pages in your application for free without any restrictions. You can find the GitHub link as follows.

[https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-.net-maui](https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-.net-maui)

But for the pages that use Syncfusion® controls, you must get the licenses to use those controls in your application to avoid the license validation pop-ups. The Syncfusion® provides free community licenses that provide access to all the Syncfusion® products for individual developers and small businesses. 
(updated links are below to know more about the Syncfusion® free community licenses).

Alternatively, you can replace the Syncfusion® controls with the framework controls and use them to avoid getting any license issues.
