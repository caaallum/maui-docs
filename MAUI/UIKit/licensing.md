But for the pages that use Syncfusion® controls, you must get the licenses to use those controls in your application to avoid the license validation pop-ups. The Syncfusion® provides free community licenses that provide access to all the Syncfusion® products for individual developers and small businesses. 
(updated links are below to know more about the Syncfusion® free community licenses).

Alternatively, you can replace the Syncfusion® controls with the framework controls and use them to avoid getting any license issues.
