# MAUI UI Kit Overview

The [Syncfusion Essential UI Kit]() is a collection of easy-to-use, extendable, and adaptable XAML pages designed to help you quickly build a MAUI application. It provides a set of generic, pre-defined screens that can be easily customized. Currently, the UI Kit includes screens for the following categories:

* Forms
* Catalog
* Detail
* Chat
* Article
* Reviews and Ratings
* Contact Us
* About Us
* Navigation
* Error and Empty
* Transaction
* Bookmark
* History
* Social
* Profile
* Tracking
* Settings
* Notification

The screens are developed using the MVVM pattern, which effectively separates the UI from the business logic, resulting in a clean, professional, and scalable user interface for your MAUI applications. You can download the UI Kit application from the [Google Play Store]() and access the complete source code available in [GitHub repository]()
