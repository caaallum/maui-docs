# MAUI UI Kit Overview

The [Syncfusion Essential UI Kit](https://www.syncfusion.com/essential-ui-kit-for-.net-maui) is a collection of easy-to-use, extendable, and adaptable XAML pages that allows you to quickly create a MAUI application by providing generic pre-defined screens. Now, the UI Kit has screens for the following categories:

* Forms
* Catalog
* Detail
* Chat
* Article
* Reviews and Ratings
* Contact Us
* About Us
* Navigation
* Error and Empty
* Transaction
* Bookmark
* History
* Social
* Profile
* Tracking
* Settings
* Notification

The screens are developed with MVVM pattern, which separates the UI and business logic results in a clean, professional, and scalable representation of user interface in your Xamarin.Forms applications. You can get the UI Kit application from [Google Play Store]() and the complete source code is available in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-.net-maui)
